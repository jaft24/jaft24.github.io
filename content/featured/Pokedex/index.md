A feature-rich Pokédex web app with pagination, multi-parameter filtering, and capturing capabilities. It also has NextAuth for SSO and Social Login, and Keycloak for user and password management.  <br><br>
Currently researching and testing Capacitor to run my pokedex natively on iOS, Android, and Web without modifying my source code.
